physical/symbolic link:
1-using the touch command to create a file: $touch meteorites.txt
$nano meteorites.txt
As NASA continues to track a 45-meter-wide asteroid very closely
diameter that will graze the Earth on Friday evening, a meteor shower caused,
violent explosions in the lower layers of the atmosphere over the Urals and parts of central Russia on Friday
ctrl+x
2-to create a physical link, use the ln command: $ln meteorites.txt lien_ph.txt
3- $ln -s link_ph.txt link_sym.txt
4-$rm meteorites.txt
5-$ls link_sym.txt
displays: link_sym.txt

Basic command
1- $ mkdir linux/exercises/exercise1
$mkdir linux/exercises/exercise2
$mkdir linux/exercises/exercise3
$mkdir linux/tps/tp1
$mkdir linux/tps/tp2
$mkdir linux/tps/tp3
2- move using cd: Cd ~/linux/exercises/exercise2 3-$touch ex01.txt
$nano ex01.txt
phrasing
crtl+x
4-we move using cd to a relative path: $Cd ~/linux/tps/tp3
5-we return using cd with ~ is the home directory: $Cd ~ 6-$pwd
7-instead of writing several mkdir we just have one: $ mkdir -p course/chapter1 course/chapter2 course/chapter3 course/chapter4
8-move using the move command (mv): $mv ~/linux/exercises/exercise2
9-we also rename with the move (mv) command: $mv ex01.txt exercise1.txt
10-we move and rename with the same mv command: $ mv ~/linux/exercises/exercise2
$mv exercise2 ex2.txt
11- we delete a file by rm: $rm ex2.txt
12- we delete all the directories by rm (including non-empty): rm -rf ~/linux
basic command part 2:
1-$mkdir tp3
2-move using cd: $cd tp3
3-to display the contents of a directory using ls and grep for searching: $ls /dev | grep ^sd
4-we use the cat command to know and create the name of a file at the same time: $cat <<Tiba> recherche.txt
>Each of the functional levels is described in the Details box.
>Choosing the Windows Server 2008 forest functional level ensures that all
>domains in the forest operate at the Windows Server 2008 domain functional
>level, which enables several new features provided by Windows Server 2008.
>Tiba
5-we search by grep (the line numbers and the word windows appear in a different color): $grep -rn windows search.txt
6-We replace with the command sed sui allows to make the substitution: $sed 's/2008/2012/g' recherche.txt | tee win2012.txt
7-use the following commands:
$tar cvf win2012.txt.tar win2012.txt
will display: win2012.txt
$ls win2012.txt.tar
win2012.txt.tar
$tar cvf search.txt.tar search.txt
search.txt
$ls search.txt.tar
search.txt.tar
8- we use the gzip command to compress: $gzip recherche.txt.tar
